**Program Structures and Algorithms:  SEC 02 INFO6205, Spring 2017**

** **

**Instructor: Ashish**

**CourseDescription:** In this course we will discuss fundamentals of programmingdata structures and basic algorithms. We will cover data structures of arrays,linked list, stacks and queues, hash tables and hash maps, trees, graphs,suffix trees and few other specialized data structures. We would also learnabout order of complexities for each one of these data structures. In additionto this we would be discussing searching and sorting, backtracking, dynamicprogramming, bit manipulation, pattern searching etc.  

**Prereq.INFO 6205**. Basic understanding of any high level programminglanguage.  

**Grading:(TBD)** Assignments/Quizzes  60%,Mid Term 20% Final 20%
